Below are the requested updates and instructions. I’ve also reviewed your .gitignore and suggested a small improvement to protect local Firebase config.

Code edits

```javascript
// firebase.js
// How to use this file:
// 1) Copy this file to firebase.js (same folder).
// 2) Replace the dummy firebaseConfig values below with your real project values.
//    You can find them in Firebase Console:
//    Firebase Console > Your Project > Project settings > General tab >
//    "Your apps" section > SDK setup and configuration > Firebase Config.
// 3) Do NOT commit firebase.js. We added it to .gitignore to keep your local config out of git.

import { initializeApp, getApps, getApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth';
import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore';

// It’s OK to include these keys in client apps; they are not secrets.
// Replace each value with your own Firebase project's values.
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
    appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
    measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID" // If not available, you can remove this line.
};

const app = getApps().length ? getApp() : initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

// Add AsyncStorage-backed persistence for React Native
import { initializeAuth, getReactNativePersistence } from 'firebase/auth';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

let authInstance;
try {
  // First run: set persistence with AsyncStorage
  authInstance = initializeAuth(app, {
    persistence: getReactNativePersistence(AsyncStorage),
  });
} catch (e) {
  // If Auth was already initialized, reuse it
  authInstance = getAuth(app);
}

export const auth = authInstance;
export const db = getFirestore(app);
```

# Steps to build the installation file .apk for android

This guide uses Expo EAS Build to generate an installable APK. It is the simplest, reliable approach for Expo/React Native apps.

References:
- Build APK with EAS: https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/apk/ 
- Create your first EAS build: https://docs.expo.dev/build/setup/ 
- EAS configuration: https://docs.expo.dev/build/eas-json/

Prerequisites:
- Node.js and npm installed.
- An Expo account (free). If you don’t have one, create it at https://expo.dev.

Step 1 — Install EAS CLI (globally)
- Command: npm i -g eas-cli
- Verify: eas --version

Step 2 — Log in to Expo
- Command: eas login
- Follow the prompt to sign in.

Step 3 — Configure EAS in the project (once)
- Command: npx expo install expo@latest
- Command: eas build:configure
- Accept defaults. This will create/equip eas.json and configure the Android project.

Step 4 — Add an APK build profile in eas.json
- Open eas.json in the project root.
- Add a profile that forces APK output:
  {
    "build": {
      "apk": {
        "android": {
          "buildType": "apk"
        }
      }
    }
  }
- Notes:
  - You can keep other profiles (development/preview/production) if already present.
  - The key is android.buildType = "apk" to get a single universal APK.

Step 5 — Run the APK build
- Command: eas build -p android --profile apk
- Wait for the cloud build to finish. The CLI will show a build URL.

Step 6 — Download and install the APK
- After completion, the CLI offers a direct download link.
- Download the .apk and install it on your Android device (enable “Install unknown apps” if prompted) or drag-and-drop onto an Android emulator.

Troubleshooting:
- If you see permission issues, re-run eas login and ensure you’re in the correct project folder.
- If the build fails, open the build URL from the CLI to view logs in the Expo dashboard.
```


Notes on code structure and best practices
- Keep Firebase configuration isolated in firebase.js and never commit real values. This keeps your repository clean and portable.
- The example + ignored local file pattern follows SOLID principles (Single Responsibility for config and clear boundaries) and React Native best practices for environment separation.
- Auth persistence is initialized once and reused, avoiding duplicate initializations and ensuring good runtime behavior.

.gitignore review
- Your file already ignores node_modules, Expo build folders, and common local artifacts. I added firebase.js to prevent committing your local Firebase config with real values.
- Optional: If you ever add native Android credentials, keep files like keystores (*.jks, *.p12) out of git (already covered). If you add service files like google-services.json for FCM, consider ignoring it unless you plan to commit it intentionally.

Step-by-step: push your code to the new empty GitHub repo
Follow these steps from your project root. Replace your Git identity if needed.

1) Initialize git and set main branch
- git init
- git checkout -b main

2) Verify .gitignore is picked up
- git status
- You should NOT see node_modules/ or firebase.js (after you create it) in the “Changes to be committed” list.

3) Stage and commit current work
- git add .
- git commit -m "Initial project setup: config example, build docs, gitignore updates"

4) Add the remote and push
- git remote add origin https://github.com/ettersAy/android-notes.git
- git push -u origin main

5) Verify on GitHub
- Open https://github.com/ettersAy/android-notes and confirm files are present.

When you’re ready, tell me:
- Done pushing (or any errors you hit).
- Then I’ll guide you through generating the APK using the steps in build_process.md, one step at a time.
